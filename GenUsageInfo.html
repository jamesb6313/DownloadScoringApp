    <li><p>
	Upon initial launch a pop up will ask for user name and target distance (i.e. Details).<br>
	This information is used to record your score and is optional.<br>
	If it is not entered then it will appear again the next time the app is launched.<br>
	Else, if it is entered it wil be stored locally on your phone. It will be displayed on the saved score card and used the next time the app is launched.<br>
	This information can be changed later by using the "Detail" button.
	</p></li>
    <li><p>
	Place and hold finger on target image and a virtual arrow point will appear, just above and to left of this point.<br>
	Also, the current score of this point is displayed in the bottom left of the target image.<br>
	While holding, move finger to position the virtual arrow point to register its score.<br>
	When satisfied with the placement and score remove finger.<br>
	The score will now register in the appropriate arrow box on the score card.<br>
	If positioning or score is incorrect it can be correct by using th "Redo" button (see below).
	</p></li>
	<li><p>
	Continue to do this for all arrows shot. The arrows will be grouped into threes and have an associated color for the group.<br>
	As each score is registered on the score card a running total will be displayed, for each group of six arrows, in the last box at end of each line on the score card.<br>
	The Running total for all shots will be displayed at the bottom left of the score card and also in the apps heading.<br>
